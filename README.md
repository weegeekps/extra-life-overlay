## How to use

The overlay is hosted using GitHub Pages. For specific usage instructions with [OBS Studio](#using-with-obs-studio) or [XSplit Broadcaster](#using-with-xsplit-broadcaster) please see the relevant sections below.

### Getting your Extra Life Participant ID

You will need to get your participant ID in order to use this overlay. To get your participant ID:

1. Go to your Extra Life page.
2. Note the URL, you should see something like `https://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donordrive.participant&participantID=123456`
3. Take the number to the right of the `participantID=`, this number is your participant ID. In the example this is `123456`.

### General instructions

Add a Browser Source to your scene using the url below replacing `<participant_id>` with your participant ID:

```
https://weegeekps.github.io/extra-life-overlay?participant=<participant_id>
```

#### Adjusting Orientation

You can change the orientation to the right side of the screen by adding `&orientation=right` to the end of the above URL. That will give you a URL like:

```
https://weegeekps.github.io/extra-life-overlay?participant=<participant_id>&orientation=right
```

If you do this after loading the Browser Source the first time, you may need to clear the cache for the Browser Source or restart your client.

#### Using for your Team instead of a single Participant

In order to display the team donations instead of participant donations, you can replace `participant` with `team` and use your team ID as the value. To get your team ID follow these instructions. Note these are largely identical to the participant instructions, but use `team` in the extra-life-overlay url instead of `participant`.

1. Go to your Extra Life team page.
2. Note the URL, you should see something like `https://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.team&teamID=12345`
3. Take the number to the right of `teamId=`, this number is your team ID. In the example this is `12345`.

Then add a Browser Source to your scene with the following URL and replacing `<team_id>` with your team ID:

```
https://weegeekps.github.io/extra-life-overlay?team=<team_id>
```

### Using with OBS Studio
